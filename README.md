# Predicting-transfer-values-of-players

The problem I will be considering concerns predicting the transfer values of football players. Transfer values of players are extremely important in today's world of football, where the amounts of transfers carried out reach ten and even several hundred million dollars. Predicting these values is of great importance to clubs, football agencies and other stakeholders in this market. The goal of the problem is to create a predictive model that can estimate the transfer value of a given player based on various factors, such as age, position of the player, statistics, what club he plays for, etc. Predicting the transfer values of soccer players can contribute to more efficient management of the resources of soccer clubs, better evaluation of investments in talent, and help discover young talented players.
